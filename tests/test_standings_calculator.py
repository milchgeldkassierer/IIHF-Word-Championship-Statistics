"""
Comprehensive test suite for StandingsCalculator service.
Tests the refactored standings calculation logic to ensure:
1. No functionality changes from original implementations
2. Correct handling of all game result types
3. Proper edge case handling (None values, ties, etc.)
4. Performance improvements
